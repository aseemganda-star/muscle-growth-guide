            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Muscles need the right fuel. Eating enough calories and protein supports recovery and growth — and quantity + quality food matters.</p>
            <p>Training alone isn’t enough to build muscle — your body needs the right fuel. Food provides the energy and nutrients required for muscle repair, recovery, and growth. Without enough calories and protein, even the best workout plan will produce limited results. Nutrition supports everything happening behind the scenes after training.</p>
            <p>Protein plays a key role because it supplies amino acids, which are the building blocks of muscle. Carbohydrates are also important, as they fuel workouts and help recovery, while healthy fats support hormone production. A balanced diet helps the body perform better both inside and outside the gym.</p>
            <p>Eating for muscle growth doesn’t mean overeating junk food. Consistency and food quality matter more than extremes. Understanding calories, portion sizes, and nutrient balance allows sustainable progress without unnecessary fat gain or energy crashes.</p>
