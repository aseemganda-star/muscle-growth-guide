            <h2>Welcome to the Muscle Growth Guide</h2>
            <p>Building muscle and improving physical health is not about one single factor — it is the result of training, nutrition, recovery, and individual body differences working together. Effective workouts provide the stimulus needed for muscles to grow, but without proper technique and weight selection, progress can slow or injuries can occur. Structured training that focuses on gradual progression helps the body adapt safely and consistently over time.</p>
            <p>Nutrition plays a critical role in supporting these physical changes. Muscles require energy and nutrients to repair and grow after workouts, especially protein for muscle repair and carbohydrates for training performance. Eating enough of the right foods allows the body to recover properly and maintain energy levels. A balanced diet supports long-term progress better than extreme or short-term eating approaches.</p>
            <p>Recovery, particularly sleep, is just as important as exercise and diet. During rest, the body repairs muscle tissue and regulates hormones that influence growth and strength. Without adequate sleep and recovery, training effectiveness decreases and fatigue builds up. Allowing the body time to recover helps prevent burnout and supports consistent improvement.</p>
            <p>Finally, body factors such as height, weight, and genetics influence how progress looks but do not determine whether progress is possible. Every individual responds differently to training, and comparing results can be misleading. Understanding realistic expectations and focusing on personal improvement encourages consistency, confidence, and sustainable results over time.</p>
