            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> People's bodies respond differently to training. Height, weight and body structure don't stop progress, but they change how things look and how training feels. These videos help explain that.</p>
            <p>Everyone’s body responds differently to training due to factors like height, bone structure, muscle insertions, and genetics. These differences can affect how muscles look, how fast strength increases, and how exercises feel. However, they do not limit progress — they simply change how results appear.</p>
            <p>Bodyweight alone doesn’t tell the full story. Muscle is denser than fat, so changes in strength and appearance may not always reflect immediately on the scale. This is why focusing only on weight can be misleading. Strength gains, measurements, and performance are often better indicators of progress.</p>
            <p>Understanding realistic expectations is important for motivation. Muscle growth takes time, especially naturally. By focusing on consistency rather than comparison, people can build confidence, discipline, and long-term results regardless of body type or height.</p>
