            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This category explains how to work out effectively and choose the right weights so your muscles actually grow. Muscle growth happens when stress from weights triggers adaptation, and recovery builds strength — not while you're lifting.</p>
            <p>Building muscle isn’t about lifting the heaviest weight possible every session. It’s about applying consistent resistance that challenges your muscles while still allowing proper form. When you lift weights, tiny muscle fibres break down, and your body repairs them to become stronger and bigger. This process is called muscle hypertrophy, and it only happens when training is done correctly over time.</p>
            <p>Choosing the right weight is one of the most important parts of training. If the weight is too light, your muscles don’t receive enough stimulus to grow. If it’s too heavy, form breaks down and the risk of injury increases. A good rule is using a weight that allows you to complete your reps with effort while still maintaining control, especially on the final few reps.</p>
            <p>Workout structure also matters. Training volume (sets and reps), frequency (how often you train a muscle), and progression (gradually increasing difficulty) all work together to drive results. Understanding these basics helps prevent wasted effort and keeps progress steady, especially for beginners.</p>
