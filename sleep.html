            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Muscle doesn't grow in the gym — it grows when you rest, sleep, and recover after training. Good sleep also helps hormones that build muscle.</p>
            <p>Muscle growth does not happen during workouts — it happens during recovery. Sleep is when the body releases important hormones that repair muscle tissue and support physical development. Without enough sleep, progress slows down no matter how hard someone trains or how well they eat.</p>
            <p>Lack of recovery can lead to fatigue, weaker workouts, poor focus, and stalled results. Overtraining without enough rest can even increase injury risk. Rest days, proper sleep, and listening to your body are just as important as lifting weights.</p>
            <p>Good recovery habits include sleeping consistently, managing stress, staying hydrated, and allowing muscles time to heal between sessions. Treating recovery as part of training helps maintain long-term progress and overall health.</p>
